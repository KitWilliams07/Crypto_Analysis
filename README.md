# Crypto_Analysis


# Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is take Crypto Data and use Unsupervised ML to group the data into seperate classes. 

To begin, the data was loaded in and a lot of cleaning took place, such as: removing null values, setting index values to crypto names, converting categorical values into numeric for the ML algorithm, and scaling / normalizing the data.
